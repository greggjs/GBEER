# notes:
# I do not know why I have this program included here.  It appears to be useful for gathering information about sequences, and returning full pathway
# information.  

usage: file_lists.py [-h] [-i FOLDER] [-o FOLDER] [-f FILE] [-n INT]

Determine information about the genbank files under study, and report this
information for use by other modules.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i FOLDER, --infolder FOLDER
                        Folder containing all genbank files for use by the
                        program.
  -o FOLDER, --outfolder FOLDER
                        Folder where results will be stored.
  -f FILE, --filter FILE
                        File restrictiong which accession numbers this script
                        will process. If no file is provided, filtering is not
                        performed.
  -n INT, --num_proc INT
                        Number of processors that you want this script to run
                        on. The default is every CPU that the system has.


regulondb_dl_parse.py

usage: regulondb_dl_parse.py [-h] [-i FOLDER] [-o FOLDER] [-f FILE] [-n INT]
                             [-d] [-u URL] [-e] [-m INT]

Download and parse a regulonDB operon file, then determine information about
the component genes by investigating the refrence organisms.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i FOLDER, --infolder FOLDER
                        Folder containing all genbank files for use by the
                        program.
  -o FOLDER, --outfolder FOLDER
                        Folder where results will be stored.
  -f FILE, --filter FILE
                        File restrictiong which accession numbers this script
                        will process. If no file is provided, filtering is not
                        performed.
  -n INT, --num_proc INT
                        Number of processors that you want this script to run
                        on. The default is every CPU that the system has.
  -d, --download        Add this option if you wish to download the regulonDB
                        operon, otherwise the program will assume that you
                        have already done this step.
  -u URL, --url URL     URL to the regulondb OperonSet.txt file.
  -e, --experimantal    Add this option if you wish to download the regulonDB
                        operon, otherwise the program will assume that you
                        have already done this step.
  -m INT, --min_genes INT
                        Minum number of genes that an operon must contain
                        before it can be considered for further analysis. The
                        default is 5 because that is what we are currently
                        using in the study.
